## turn-based-team

from create-vite-app:
`yarn create vite . --template react-ts`

and [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/tutorial)

NOTE: boardgame.io [doesn't work](https://github.com/boardgameio/boardgame.io/issues/1073) w/ React 18 so had to downgrade to React 17

### TODO

- destructable walls
- multiple weapons swap
- action point system
- move point system
- armor, weapons, gear (usables), grenades
- fog of war/line of sight?
